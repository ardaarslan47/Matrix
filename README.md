# Matrix Manipulation Project

This project provides a C++ implementation for basic matrix manipulation operations, including addition, multiplication, transpose, determinant calculation, adjoint matrix calculation, and matrix inversion. It includes classes for handling general matrices and square matrices (quadratic matrices).

## Features

- Addition of matrices of the same size
- Multiplication of matrices
- Transpose of matrices
- Determinant calculation for square matrices
- Adjoint matrix calculation for square matrices
- Inverse matrix calculation for square matrices

## Getting Started
